According to Public Health Reports, "seventy-five percent of Americans have trouble taking their medicine as directed. This lack of adherence is costing many people their good health and the health-care system billions of dollars"(Benjamin, 2012). Medcheck is a ruby on rails app that aims to help users keep track of important medication information. This includes, when to take the medications, what dose to take, how many you have left, and when you next need to pick up medications. I need to take medications every day, and I always forget important details. I wanted to make something for myself and everyone else that goes through the same struggles. There's an api endpoint for taking medications that is compatible with nfc tags.
